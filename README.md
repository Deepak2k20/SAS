# SAS

# What is SAS?

SAS (Statistical analysis system) is one of the most popular software for data analysis. It is widely used for various purposes such as data management, data mining, report writing, statistical analysis, business modeling, applications development and data warehousing.

Knowing SAS is an asset in many job markets. It is tagged 'leader' in Advanced Analytics Platforms as per Gartner Magic Quadrant for Data Science and Machine Learning Platforms throughout all eight years since its inception.

# SAS Modules

When you install SAS software, it has several in-built modules which are designed for various analytics and reporting purposes. See some of the common SAS modules or components.

Base SAS - It is the most common SAS module. It is used for data manipulation such as filtering data, selecting, renaming or removing columns, reshaping data etc.  

SAS/STAT - It runs popular statistical techniques such as Hypothesis Testing, Linear and Logistic Regression, Principal Component Analysis etc.  

SAS/ACCESS - It lets you to read data from databases such as Teradata, SQL Server, Oracle DB2 etc.  

SAS/GRAPH - You can create simple and complex graphs using this component.  

SAS/ETS - You can perform time series forecasting such as ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, Moving Average etc. using this module.

The purpose of this post is to help you understand the fundamentals of SAS programming. It is intended to give first time users an idea about the SAS software and how to access it and get you up and ready with SAS programming. At the end of this tutorial, you would be acquainted with SAS basic syntax rules, how to enter data into SAS, variable types and how to run a program in SAS.  

If you really want to make your career in analytics, you should focus on learning SAS programming as SAS is a world leader in softwares for advanced analytics. To see the real potential of SAS programming, login to any job portal and search for jobs required skill set of SAS. You would find a large number of jobs waiting for you if you know SAS.  

SAS stands for Statistical Analysis System.

# What SAS can do?

SAS can perform the following tasks:

It allows you to enter, retrieve and manage your data easily  

It can read data from various external sources (Excel, CSV, Text files, Databases, Webpage etc)  

You can explore and manipulate data in SAS.  

It can analyze your data statistically and mathematically. Includes various statistical techniques. 

It can generate beautiful graphs and tables.  

You can run SQL queries on SAS datasets.  

You can automate repetitive tasks with SAS Macros.  

It can develop entirely new software applications.  

# Basics of SAS Programming

SAS has three main windows :

1) Editor Window: where you type programs for analyzing data  
2) Log Window: where error messages and executed SAS commands are printed  
3) Result Window: where the result of SAS programs are printed.

# Basic SAS Program

Let's look at a simple SAS program :

```sas
data example1;
input name $ ID;
cards;
Sam 12
Sandy 13
Reno 11
Farhan 10
;

proc print;
run;
 
```sas


data example1;: This line initiates a data step and creates a new dataset named "example1" to store the data.

input name $ ID;: This line defines the variables for the dataset. It specifies that there are two variables: "name" and "ID." The dollar sign ($) after "name" indicates that it is a character variable, and the lack of a dollar sign after "ID" indicates that it is a numeric variable.

cards;: This keyword signals the start of inline data. The data enclosed between cards; and the next semicolon (;) will be read as input data for the dataset.

The lines following cards; contain the actual data values. Each line represents one observation (row) in the dataset. In this example, there are four observations with two variables each: "name" and "ID."

proc print;: This line initiates the proc print procedure, which is used to display the contents of a dataset.

run;: This line signifies the end of the data step and the end of the proc print procedure.
